# Requirements Document

## Introduction

IDE双空间智能管理插件是一个基于AI驱动的VSCode扩展，提供代码与文档的智能双空间管理功能。该插件旨在通过AI辅助和智能关联系统，实现代码和文档之间的无缝同步和管理，提升开发者的文档编写效率和代码维护质量。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create associations between code files and documentation files, so that I can maintain clear relationships between my code and its documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a code file and a documentation file THEN the system SHALL create a bidirectional association between them
2. WHEN I create an association THEN the system SHALL store the association metadata including type, description, and creation timestamp
3. WHEN I view a code file THEN the system SHALL display all associated documentation files in the UI
4. WHEN I delete a file THEN the system SHALL prompt me to handle related associations
5. IF an association already exists between two files THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate associations and show an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI to automatically generate documentation from my code, so that I can save time and ensure comprehensive documentation coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select code and request documentation generation THEN the system SHALL analyze the code structure and generate appropriate documentation
2. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL support multiple programming languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust)
3. WHEN AI generates documentation THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and improvement suggestions
4. WHEN AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to template-based generation or alternative providers
5. IF the generated documentation is unsatisfactory THEN the system SHALL allow manual editing and regeneration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time synchronization between code changes and documentation, so that my documentation stays up-to-date with code modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify code that has associated documentation THEN the system SHALL detect the change and notify me of sync opportunities
2. WHEN sync is triggered THEN the system SHALL analyze code changes and suggest documentation updates
3. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options (manual, auto-code, auto-doc)
4. WHEN sync is completed THEN the system SHALL update the last sync timestamp and log the operation
5. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dual-pane interface to view and edit code and documentation simultaneously, so that I can work efficiently in a unified workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the dual-space view THEN the system SHALL display code and documentation in separate, resizable panes
2. WHEN I adjust the pane ratio THEN the system SHALL remember my preference and apply it to future sessions
3. WHEN I navigate between associated files THEN the system SHALL automatically load the corresponding file in the opposite pane
4. WHEN I edit content in either pane THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and auto-completion appropriate to the file type
5. IF I switch between edit and preview modes THEN the system SHALL maintain the current scroll position and selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code analysis and documentation suggestions, so that I can improve code quality and documentation completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze code THEN the system SHALL calculate complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, function count)
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify common issues (missing comments, long functions, code smells)
3. WHEN providing suggestions THEN the system SHALL recommend specific improvements for code structure and documentation
4. WHEN I request documentation suggestions THEN the system SHALL analyze code patterns and suggest appropriate documentation sections
5. IF code complexity exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL highlight areas needing attention and suggest refactoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure storage and management of AI API keys, so that my credentials are protected while enabling AI functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure AI providers THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store API keys in the system keychain
2. WHEN accessing AI services THEN the system SHALL decrypt keys securely without exposing them in logs or UI
3. WHEN switching between AI providers THEN the system SHALL maintain separate, secure configurations for each provider
4. WHEN an API key is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and configuration guidance
5. IF I remove the plugin THEN the system SHALL clean up all stored credentials from the keychain

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization, so that the plugin doesn't impact my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing operations THEN the system SHALL monitor response times and memory usage
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log warnings and suggest optimizations
3. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL implement multi-level caching (memory, file, database) with appropriate TTL
4. WHEN the plugin starts THEN the system SHALL activate within 2 seconds and consume less than 50MB of memory
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recovery options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that I can continue working even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them (system, business, AI service, user input) and provide appropriate responses
2. WHEN AI services fail THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback providers and graceful degradation
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN sync conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL preserve both versions and offer merge tools
5. IF the system encounters critical errors THEN it SHALL log detailed information for debugging while maintaining user privacy

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and quality assurance, so that I can rely on the plugin's stability and correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL have at least 80% test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E tests
2. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL validate all core functionality including association management, AI integration, and sync operations
3. WHEN performance tests execute THEN the system SHALL verify response times and resource usage meet specified thresholds
4. WHEN security tests run THEN the system SHALL validate input sanitization, API key protection, and access controls
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information and prevent deployment

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible architecture and configuration options, so that I can customize the plugin to my specific needs and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the plugin THEN the system SHALL provide settings for sync behavior, AI providers, UI preferences, and performance options
2. WHEN adding new AI providers THEN the system SHALL support plugin architecture with standardized interfaces
3. WHEN customizing UI THEN the system SHALL adapt to VSCode themes and provide responsive design for different screen sizes
4. WHEN integrating with other tools THEN the system SHALL provide APIs and extension points for third-party integrations
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate settings and provide helpful error messages with correction suggestions

# Product Requirements & Design Principles

## Core Product Vision
IDE双空间智能管理插件 (IDE Dual-Space Intelligent Management Plugin) - An AI-driven VSCode extension that creates seamless bidirectional synchronization between code and documentation through intelligent association mapping.

## Primary Use Cases & User Flows

### Core User Journey
1. **Association Creation**: User selects code elements and links them to documentation sections
2. **Intelligent Sync**: AI detects code changes and suggests documentation updates
3. **Dual-Space Navigation**: Seamless switching between related code and documentation
4. **AI-Assisted Generation**: Automatic documentation generation from code analysis

### Target User Personas
- **Solo Developers**: Need better documentation habits with minimal overhead
- **Team Leads**: Require standardized documentation workflows across teams
- **OSS Maintainers**: Must maintain high-quality project documentation
- **Enterprise Teams**: Need compliance and consistency in code documentation

## Feature Requirements & Constraints

### Must-Have Features (MVP)
- Dual-pane interface with code and documentation views
- File association system linking code files to documentation
- Real-time change detection and sync notifications
- Basic AI integration for documentation suggestions
- VSCode native integration with familiar UI patterns

### Should-Have Features (V1.1)
- Multi-AI provider support (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
- Advanced association types (function-level, class-level mapping)
- Batch synchronization operations
- Team collaboration features
- Configuration management system

### Could-Have Features (Future)
- Multi-IDE support (Cursor, other editors)
- Advanced analytics and usage tracking
- Custom AI model training
- Enterprise SSO integration

## Design Principles & Constraints

### User Experience Principles
- **Zero Learning Curve**: Leverage existing VSCode patterns and conventions
- **Non-Intrusive**: Plugin should enhance, not disrupt existing workflows
- **Performance First**: Operations must be fast and responsive (<500ms for most actions)
- **Fail Gracefully**: Provide meaningful fallbacks when AI services are unavailable

### Technical Constraints
- **VSCode API Compliance**: Must work within VSCode extension limitations
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage <50MB, minimal CPU impact
- **Offline Capability**: Core features must work without internet connection
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux

### AI Integration Guidelines
- **Provider Agnostic**: Support multiple AI providers with unified interface
- **Cost Conscious**: Implement caching and rate limiting to minimize API costs
- **Privacy Aware**: Never send sensitive code to external services without explicit consent
- **Fallback Ready**: Template-based generation when AI services unavailable

## Business Logic & Rules

### Association Rules
- One code file can associate with multiple documentation files
- Documentation sections can link to multiple code elements
- Associations must be explicitly created by users (no automatic assumptions)
- Broken associations should be flagged but not auto-deleted

### Synchronization Logic
- Changes trigger notifications, not automatic updates
- User must approve AI-suggested changes
- Maintain change history for rollback capability
- Batch operations for multiple file changes

### AI Behavior Rules
- Always provide context about what code is being analyzed
- Generate suggestions, never make automatic changes
- Respect user's preferred documentation style and format
- Cache responses to reduce API calls and costs

## Success Metrics & Quality Gates

### User Engagement Metrics
- Daily active users and session duration
- Feature adoption rates (association creation, AI usage)
- User retention (7-day, 30-day cohorts)
- Documentation quality improvements (measurable through AI analysis)

### Technical Performance Metrics
- Extension activation time <2 seconds
- Association creation response time <500ms
- AI response time <5 seconds
- Memory usage <50MB average
- Error rate <1% for core operations

### Quality Requirements
- Unit test coverage >80%
- User satisfaction score >4.0/5.0
- Support ticket volume <5% of user base
- Crash rate <0.1% of sessions

## Localization & Accessibility

### Language Support
- Primary: English and Chinese (Simplified)
- Documentation should be bilingual where appropriate
- UI text must be externalized for future localization

### Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation for all features
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast theme support
- Configurable font sizes and UI scaling
